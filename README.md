#Origo

An easy to configure framework for creating your own web mapping applications.

## What is Origo?

Origo is a web mapping framework. It is based on the [OpenLayers 3 library](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3). You can use Origo to create your own desktop-like web mapping applications. The project is run and maintained by a number of Swedish municipalities.

## Features

* Responsive design
* Support for older browsers
* Multiple modules available (among others: an editor interface, geopositioning and map sharing)
* Ability to read data from multiple different types of sources
* Very light footprint

## How to get started

We will be using releases that you can download to get started. The project is still in its early stages. We are working hard to get a first version published, although there is currently no timeline for when this will happen.

## Documentation

In the documentation you will find detailed how-to instructions as well as the API-documentation. It is currently being worked on and it will be linked here as soon as it is done.

## Want to contribute?
We happily accept contributions of any kind. Guidelines will be available at a later date.

Thank you for considering contributing to Origo.
